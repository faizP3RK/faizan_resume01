# Frontend for Resume Website

## Overview
This directory hosts the frontend components of the Resume Website. It is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures that the website is accessible across all devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements:** JavaScript is used to enhance user interactions for a dynamic experience.

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML document for the website. It structures the webpage and includes links to CSS and JavaScript files.
- `/css/`: Contains CSS files for styling the website. Stylesheets are organized to make the site visually appealing and user-friendly.
- `/js/`: Contains JavaScript files that add interactivity to the web pages.

## Deployment
For deployment, static files from the frontend directory need to be hosted on a web server or integrated with backend services if required. This can be achieved by:
- Uploading files to a static hosting service like Azure Static Web Apps or GitHub Pages.
- Configuring the web server to serve the `index.html` as the entry point.
